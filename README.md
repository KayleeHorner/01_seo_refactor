In this project, I analyzed the code and reworked it to make it SEO friendly. I also went through and made sure to make the code more accessible by adding alt tags to my images and making my HTML semantic. The CSS sheet had a lot of repeating elements that I was able to whittle down to a more user-friendly code for future editing.
